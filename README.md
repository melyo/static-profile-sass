# Legacy Profile and Resume Website

This project is the old version of my personal profile and resume website, created in the year 2017, using a combination of static site technologies, including jQuery and SASS, to create a dynamic and stylish online presence. This project focused on showcasing professional qualifications and achievements through an engaging and responsive web interface.

Key Features:

- **Static Website**: Utilized HTML for a solid structure and CSS for styling, creating a fast-loading and reliable resume site.
jQuery Integration: Employed jQuery to enhance user interactivity with smooth animations, dynamic content updates, and improved user experience.
- **SASS** for Styling: Leveraged SASS to streamline and modularize CSS, enabling more maintainable and scalable stylesheets with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

This static resume website serves as a comprehensive online portfolio, effectively presenting my professional background and skills in a visually appealing manner.
